# Python Projects
Python projects for learning and general interest - learning by doing. Each is a topic I've covered theoretically, but wanted to understand in more detail.

- [GAN](GAN/) - Generative Adversarial Network, a generative model implemented with PyTorch.
- [VAE](VAE/) - Variational Autoencoder, another generative model implemented with PyTorch.
- [Neural ODEs](neural_odes/) - Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, a demo of an alternative modelling approach that is of particular interest for modelling time series data.
- [Routing algorithms](routing_algorithms/) - Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford routing algorithms, for finding the least costly path between two nodes in a network.
